# FashionMnist:Artificial_Intelligence

## In this project I have used the fashion mnist dataset to predict the diferrent types of clothing using CNN and DNN.

## I have also implemented various callbacks and has tried predicting using a functional and sequential model.

## I also got an accuracy of 91% on the test dataset on evaluation.

## Moreover,I have also visualized the convolution layer's filters and filtermaps using subplots to develop a better understanding of how the CNN works.

## I have also visualized the layers of the model along with its inputs and outputs in the form of a flowchart.
